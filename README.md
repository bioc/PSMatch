# Handling peptide-spectrum matches

A simple package to load, hangle and manage PSMs (peptide-spectrum
matches). Code in this package is partly composed of functions ported
from [`MSnbase`](http://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase/) with the goal to
(1) make them more general and (2) integrate with the
[`Spectra`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Spectra/)
infrastructure.

Find out more about the package in the
[vignette](https://lgatto.github.io/psm/articles/psm.html).

This package will eventually be moved to the [*R for Mass
Spectrometry* organisation](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry)
and most likely renamed. It is very much work-in-progress at the
moment.
