# Handling peptide-spectrum matches

A simple package to load, hangle and manage PSMs (peptide-spectrum
matches). Code in this package is partly composed of functions ported
from `MSnbase` with the goal to (1) make them more general and (2)
integrate with the `Spectra` infrastructure.

This package will eventually be moved to the [*R for Mass
Spectrometry* organisation](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry)
and most likely renamed. It is work-in-progress and unstable at the
moment.
