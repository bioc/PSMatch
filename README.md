# Handling peptide-spectrum matches

A simple package to load, process and analyse PSMs (Peptide-Spectrum
Matches). Code in this package is partly composed of functions ported
from [`MSnbase`](http://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase/) with the goal to
(1) make them more general and (2) integrate them with the [*R for
Mass Spectrometry*](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry)
infrastructure.

Find out more about the package in the
[vignette](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/PSMatch/articles/PSMatch.html).
